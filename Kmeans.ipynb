Barrette resolved that he would return to the area after wintering in Frenchtown.  It was possibly on this trip that he met Adolph Lozeau, another French-Canadian. Lozeau operated a ranch about five miles east of the mouth of Cedar. His Forty Mile House had been a wayfarer’s stop along the Mullan Road for two years.\\r\\r\\nIt was not until the next fall that Barrette finally returned to the basin that had caught his eye. He and his partner, Basil Lanthier, climbed into the steep, cedar-crowded gulch with several pack and saddle horses loaded with enough supplies to last them several weeks. Their departure from Frenchtown was not a secret, thus many eyes would be watchful for any indications that their trip was a success.\\r\\r\\nAnd indeed, they did find gold, on October 9,1869, at the mouth of Cayuse Creek.\\r\\r\\nOnce word got past Frenchtown, men (there were no women in Cedar this early) poured in from all over the territory, Northern Idaho, the surrounding states and even the West Coast. From Missoula one correspondent to the “New North-West” wrote, “Missoula has been wild for a week.” The result, he said, was that “Hotel keepers, merchants, clerks, idle men and loafers, all are gone…”\\r\\r\\nThis frantic mob rushing into such an isolated spot presented some very real problems in the way of lack of shelter and food shortages. Packers soon poured into the snow-packed drainage with beans (50 cents a pound), bacon (75 cents a pound) and gumboots ($18 a pair). Housing was of the roughest sort-canvas shelters and brush hovels. The territory’s papers warned the determined stampeders to go “well clad, blanketed and pursed.”\\r\\r\\nThe Beer:\\r\\r\\nTaking beer back to the era of the 1850’s California Gold Rush, the Cayuse Creek Common brings the flavor. The rustic wood aromas (reminiscent of the barn wood in the taproom) of Northern Brewer hops take charge of the nose, while a slight caramel whiff lingers in the background. The rich copper color hints at the flavors of caramel and grains that collaborate with Northern Brewer hop profile. The finish is distinctly crisp and dry.',\n",

But if we dig a bit deeper, it also becomes obvious that we are a lager drinking nation. For as long as anyone can remember, we’ve been been up to our collective noses in it. The problem is that most of it has been produced as an exercise in profit and not flavour. Big beer has drifted far from the origins of this traditional style.\\r\\r\\nLagering actually dates as far back as medieval times, where brewers would barrel ferment in the cooler temperatures of caves, but the advent of refrigeration in the late 19th century helped to perpetuate it to new levels of popularity. Consistently cool temperatures, along with a bottom fermenting yeast, yielded a clear, clean and long-lasting beer which now helps define the style. A style we feel is not being faithfully represented by what’s commercially available . . . until now.\\r\\r\\nDevil’s Peak Brewing Company’s Lager has been created as an ode to the traditional lagers of Germany. Brewed with the famous noble Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, we have looked to the past to bring you the future of beer in South Africa.
